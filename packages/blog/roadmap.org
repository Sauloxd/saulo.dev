* Saulo.dev roadmap
Hi! Welcome to my blog :)
Here is the roadmap for features and other important stuff I judge worhty of
rememebering to do.


* Non-functional requirement
- SEO so the internet can find my posts
- SMO so people can share it in social medias
- Be cheap and scale as demanded


* Tech stuff
- Typed system -> Typescript
- SSR -> *Next JS*
  - When in dev, it seems to be cool to have `/api/something` to be proxied to
    `http://realapi.com/api/something` (understand the relevance on proxy)
  - Make all enpoints (*) be handled by next routes
- Use Redux for state management (?)
- I18n
  See https://pankod.github.io/next-boilerplate for i18n setup
- Tests
  - Cypress for e2e
  - Enzyme for integration
  - Jest for unit


* TODO NextJS starters
* TODO Typescript
