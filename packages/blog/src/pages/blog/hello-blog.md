# Why am I writing?
I am no philosopher. I am no writer. Heck, I am not a good communicator at all.
I tremble before an audience. I tremble typing in my keyboard thinking of what people I don't even known would think of what I am writing. I'm a coward.
But I don't want to die one.

IMO, the writing proccess of a blog post is somewhat analogous to the process for delivering software.
If you enter the blackhole for the perfect software, which will harness the lowest bugs possible, might take a lot of the project budget. If it's not a SLA heavy feature, why would you spend so many hours just trying to get rid of that `if` statement?

I know why: **Fear**

*Fear* of people's judgment when they review your code.
*Fear* of people questioning and criticizing your design decisions.
*Fear* of the complexity that a simple and innocent `if` statement would cause for the next extension/maintaince
*Fear* of that not being the best abstraction/implementation of the feature.

And writing gives me the same *Fear*:

*Fear* of people judging your writing skills
*Fear* of people disapproval of your opinions
*Fear* of writing something wrong
*Fear* of that writing not being even close to the best about the subject

We are all together trying to create a better place to minimize these kind of destructive thinking, be it in your workplace, in your own home or in the internet.

If I'm somewhat able to cope with those fears in my workplace, why can't I overcome the internet fear?

## What's next?

Ok, now that I somehow conviced myself with that crap pep talk, I'll try to post something everytime I learn something or whenever a milestone in my life is achieved.
