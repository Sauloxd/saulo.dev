# Don't be, try to: Fearless
I am no philosopher. I am no writer. Heck, I am not a good communicator at all.
I tremble before an audience. I tremble typing in my keyboard thinking of what people I don't even known would think of what I am writing. I'm a coward.
But I don't want to die one.

I think the writing proccess of a blog post is somewhat analogous to the process for delivering software.
If you enter the blackhole for the perfect software, which will harness the lowest bugs possible, might take a lot of the project budget. If it's not a SLA heavy feature, why would you spend so many hours just trying to get rid of that `if` statement?

I know why: **Fear**

*Fear* of people's judgment when they review your code.
*Fear* of people questioning and criticizing your design decisions.
*Fear* of the complexity that a simple and innocent `if` statement would cause for the next extension/maintaince
*Fear* of that not being the best abstraction/implementation of the feature.

And writing gives me the same *Fear*:

*Fear* of people judging your writing skills
*Fear* of people disapproval of your opinions
*Fear* of writing something wrong
*Fear* of that writing not being even close to the best about the subject

Fear is a feeling of self preservation, why fight against it?
That's simple, unless you live under a rock, eventually you'll have to face those fears.
Why not while doing something you love? Building things and sharing knowledge?

## What's next?
Ok, now that I somehow conviced myself with that crap pep talk, I'll try to post something everytime I learn something or whenever a milestone in my life is achieved.
